## What is SAFU?

As the crypto industry is evolving rapidly, the number of wallets getting compromised or bricked is also increasing due to scammers. Although users lose all their funds, they can still recover some of it by recovering tokens, stake, NFT’s, or by even closing the active token accounts.

SAFU(acronym for **S**olana **A**ssets & **F**unds **U**nlocker) is a platform which will help users recover their assets from a bricked wallet and transfer it to a safe wallet.

## **How it Works?**

Usually, in bricked wallets, the hacker has access to the private key and runs an automated script that monitors the wallet. Whenever the user tries to transfer funds or assets to the compromised wallet, the script immediately **triggers a transaction**, redirecting the funds to the hacker’s wallet. This makes it impossible for the user to retain control over their assets, as any attempt to use the wallet results in an instant theft, leaving the user powerless despite owning the private key.

SAFU solves the issue of bricked wallets by sending a small amount of SOL to cover transaction fees and executing a single atomic transaction. This transaction swiftly transfers the user’s assets from the compromised wallet to a secure wallet before the hacker’s bot can detect and intercept it.
